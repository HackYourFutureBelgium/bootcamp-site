  "description": "Creation of a **companion for lifelong learners**. Putting skills first, and low-barrier recognition for them second. \n\nToday’s world increasingly consists of lifelong learners - people who accept learning doesn’t stop after you’ve finished school. They have to accept it to keep up with ever-changing information, trends and industry standards. While our learning mindset is evolving, our way of recognizing that learning is falling behind.\n\n1. There's **a gap** between formal and informal recognition today\n2. Recognition is seen as a goal, instead of a **result of achieving competence**\n3. Current solutions for recognition either miss or don't capture valuable **context**\n\nStitch solves this problem!",
